# Throwback

## Concept
[itch.io Game-Off 2017](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017)
The theme this year is **throwback**. We've taken that theme and interpreted it in two distinct ways:

- Zeppelins are a throwback: nobody uses them anymore
- What if you were riding on a zeppelin gondola and you had to throw back projectiles that are thrown at you?

Hence, a game wherein you ride on a gondola and attempt to defend it from various aerial perils.
